    <p>Japanese Curry is a great dish if you are short on ingredients, or have assorted vegetables you need to get rid of.
        It differs from Indian curry by being a sweeter alternative, and uses less spices than Indian Curry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients List:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Golden Curry Blocks (I prefer medium heat)</li>
        <li>Yukon Gold or Russett Potatoes</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Beef Chuck Roast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating up 500 ml of water up to a boil.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut potatoes into sizes of your choice, then put the potatoes in the water.</li>
        <li>Do the same to carrots, first peeling them and putting them in the water.</li>
        <li>Heat up a frying pan to medium-high and coat it with a neutral oil.</li>
        <li>Fry your onions until they become semi-transparent.</li>
        <li>Season your Beef Chuck Roast with a pinch of salt and a generous amount of pepper.</li>
        <li>Slice your Beef Chuck Roast into bite sized pieces, then put them on the frying pan.</li>
        <li>Fry them along with the onions until internal temperature has reached 165 degrees.</li>
        <li>Once you are done frying your onions and beef, turn off the heat and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Break up all of the cubes, putting 2 portions (8 cubes) into the water.</li>
        <li>Keep the water at about a medium heat, and mix cubes in until fully dissolved.</li>
        <li>Lastly, put in your meat and onions into the pot.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your curry over rice!</li>
